## Planning Story

The first step was to decide on the prompt and prepare schedule to deliver the project ontime. I decided to make the we all struggle with everyday to plan family meals. I initially started with the planning out with Asana but not working in team made me not being actively filling the enteries in Asana. I went back to using paper and pen to plan out. I first desigend the schema for the database and then completed the backend. Next I designed the wireframes for the application and realized the redundant data and also to add date instead of day in order to make improvement in frontend in future iterations.

In this project we had a choice to pick frontend and backend of our choice. Since I wanted to challenge myself and learn Django I picked Django for backend and React for frontend. After completeing the backend and the wireframes, I started working on the frontend. For the first time I used react to manipulate dates and to create a table with the buttons that perform edit and delete operations. I tried different date pickers but was not able to store the date. I decided to use react-datepicker and learned how store changes to Object and run it through axios. I did not want to stop on create as it was day 3 as I was still stuck on add the record. I decided to complete the code for other crud operations.
After fixing the date error, it took a lot of google search to understand how in react you can access the id for rows in the table that you populated data with. Lot of GA's instructors help and google search helped out in completing this project.
